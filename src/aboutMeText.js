    <h1>Hello! My Name is <b>Nate</b></h1>
    <p>I started out with my passion for coding the second I got a computer while playing the at the time super popular game Minecraft.
       I witnessed creators and fellow players seemingly create things I never dreamed physically possible all on a cubed block game.
       From there I started my grueling journey in JAVA Development, but one thing I didn't account for was the fact that most guides
       are made in english while I only understood French/Creole at the time.
       Nonetheless I REFUSED to let that stop me.
       I started taking classes to help rapidly excell my english development, and before I knew it I made my first java plugin!</p>
    <h1>This Portion of my site is under development and is updated frequently ðŸ˜€</h1>
